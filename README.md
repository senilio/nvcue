### What's this?
Python rewrite of nvremind by Brett Terpsta: https://github.com/ttscoff/nvremind

### Why?
I'm a long time user of nvALT and nvremind, but lately I've had to modify the Ruby code to make it fit my needs. While Bretts code is great, I can only conclude I'm not a Ruby kind of guy, so here's my take on writing a similar service in python.
